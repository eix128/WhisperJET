FAST Offline Speech Recognition with
One of the fastest Whisper implementation that works flawlessly real-time 
cross platform with JAVA.
It works on 
Linux , Windows , OSX , Android even on IOS ( LibGDX ROBOVM near future )
Its model is far more optimized.


The quality may be increased with a cost of losing performance.
We will update for that.

The library works on Java 8 , 9 , 11 , 19 , 21 , 24+

This is the best Java Whisper Library on the internet.
Dont lose time for Whisper JNI implementations
Dont try to search more and its completely FREE

It can supports **CUDA,FAST CPU,AMD ROCM,INTEL** 
Its ram consumption for X86 is just 1.5GB MAX on JVM !!!


We tried to minimize garbage collection usage as far as we can.
We will upgrade this library more as soon as we have time more.

We will try to support library as possible to make more usable for Java.
